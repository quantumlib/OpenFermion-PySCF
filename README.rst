`OpenFermion <http://openfermion.org>`__ is an open source library (licensed under Apache 2) for compiling and analyzing quantum algorithms which simulate fermionic systems.
This plugin library allows the electronic structure package `PySCF <http://github.com/sunqm/pyscf>`__ (licensed under BSD-2-Clause) to interface with OpenFermion.

Installation
------------

To start using OpenFermion-PySCF, first install `PySCF
<http://github.com/sunqm/pyscf>`__.
Then, to install the latest versions of OpenFermion and OpenFermion-PySCF (in development mode):

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion-PySCF
  cd OpenFermion-PySCF
  python -m pip install -e .

Alternatively, to install the latest PyPI releases as libraries (in user mode):

.. code-block:: bash

  python -m pip install --pre --user openfermionpyscf

Also be sure to take a look at the `ipython notebook demo <https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion-PySCF/blob/master/examples/openfermionpyscf_demo.ipynb>`__.
